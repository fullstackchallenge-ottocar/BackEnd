# Test Driven Development - Backend API 
# Technologies used for backend
# Development
- Cross-env runs scripts that set and use environment variables across platforms
- Jest as testing framework since it provides a great testing experience for JavaScript projects
- Knex-cleaner is a helper library to clean a PostgreSQL, MySQL or SQLite3 database tables using Knex. Great for integration tests.
- Nodemon is a tool that helps develop node.js based 
- SuperTest to call our API routes since it provides an easy-to-use API to send HTTP requests in Nodeapplications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected.
- TypeScript since it greatly improves developer productivity

# Production
- Bcrypt is a library to help hash passwords.
- Body-parser is a body parsing middleware.
- Cors is used to configure API security and to allow for secure communication between the front-end and back-end servers.
- Express is a prebuilt NodeJS framework that makes creating server side applications simple, fast, and flexible. NodeJS is powered by Google's V8 Engine which means it's powerful and can handle a large number of requests without lapsing in dependability. Also, this means that this is a highly scalable choice when you consider the Event Loop which manages all asynchronous operations allowing the program to continue to run as expected without stops. 
- Jsonwebtoken - we can use JSON web tokens (JWTs) to add authentication to a Web API. JSON web tokens are an industry standard for transferring data between two parties.

JWTs are cryptographically signed, typically using a secret with the HMACSHA-256 algorithm.

A JWT is a string that has three parts separated by a period (.). Those are:

The header.
The payload.
The signature.
- Knex is a "batteries included" SQL query builder for Postgres, MSSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite3, Oracle, and Amazon Redshift designed to be flexible, portable, and fun to use.
- Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
- Sqlite3 - SQLite is a software library that provides a relational database management system. The lite in SQLite means light weight in terms of setup, database administration, and required resource.

SQLite has the following noticeable features: self-contained,serverless, zero-configuration, transactional.
